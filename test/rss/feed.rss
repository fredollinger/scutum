			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2012 has been a very good year for music. It&#8217;s the first year in a long time when I have discovered several new albums that really excite me. I mean actual new music by new bands, not reissues of some obscure LP from 1966 or even a new release by some old, established artist. I mean actual new bands who are currently working and recording. Here are my favorites from this year.</p>
<p><strong>ALLAH LAS</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fiJYecS0vU0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>These Los Angeles based garage rock revivalists got together at my favorite LA point of interest Amoeba Records. Their mutual love for the Nuggets compilations led them to form one of the best new bands currently on the scene. Their first single, &#8220;Tell Me What&#8217;s On Your Mind&#8221; is like a great lost 13th Floor Elevators classic and yet manages somehow not to sound like a relic from the Sixties but a fresh new song. Their self-titled album contains a dozen amazing and inspired folk rock tunes and spy movie instrumentals.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><strong>PAPERHEAD</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQ-8bxBHi5M" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Paperhead is from Nashville, Tennessee if you can believe that. They channel the spirit of the late great Syd Barrett right into the new millennium. I saw them play in Knoxville a couple of weeks ago. It seemed like they were having a bit of an off night and it took them until a few songs into the set the really get cooking. But once they did, it was a fantabulous show. They could use a little dressing up, though. I wish they&#8217;d take some fashion hints from <a href="http://youtu.be/Xk4abv3l-nc" target="_blank">Plasticland</a> or add a light show. Their album is a psychedelic trip from start to finish. Not to be missed!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><strong>SUFIS</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SY17o_FfxDw" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Amazingly the Sufis (or perhaps their name is S.U.F.I., it&#8217;s hard to be sure) are also from Nashville, Tennessee. Are they spiking the water with mescaline out there or what? Like Paperhead these young Southerners are obviously big fans of Syd Barrett. The Sufis are much more of a period piece than Paperhead, though. They&#8217;ve even mixed some songs on their album just like they did back in the day, with all the drums on the left and all the vocals on the right. Very cool. Another incredible album.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><strong>KOOLAID ELECTRIC COMPANY</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/KLo19vU09K8" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>As their name suggests, the Koolaid Electric Company are also psychedelic rockers. Yet their sound mixes in elements from the psychedelia of the Eighties, Nineties and 2000&#8242;s. They take the stoner rock thing to new levels by adding Byrds-like harmonies and synthesizer atmospherics. Their current album, <em>Random Noises and Organized Sounds</em>, is really hard to find. It seems to have been pressed in Japan. The copy I managed to find at Amoeba Records was an import even though as far as I know the band is American. But I&#8217;m not sure of even that much. The songs are written by one &#8220;S. Barrett,&#8221; though I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not Syd.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><strong>ZERO DEFEX</strong><br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qHZam6Shf-0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s cheezy to include my own band in this list. And we are not a new group like the others. But I genuinely think our new album, <em>Caught in a Reflection</em>, is one of the best things recorded in 2012. Of course I&#8217;m gonna think that! I wouldn&#8217;t want to participate in making a record unless I thought it was going to be great. I feel like we&#8217;ve finally begun living up to the true potential of the band. Although Zero Defex is known as a hardcore punk band, the musical tastes of everyone in the group are really eclectic. Drummer Mick Hurray plays guitar and dulcimer in an Irish trad rock band. Guitarist Jeff Hardy is a walking encyclopedia of rock and roll. Singer Jimi Imij probably has the most diverse tastes of any of us. He devours all forms of music from punk rock to Native American chants and he can tell you about all of it. This track <em>Devil&#8217;s Trip/May 4, 1970</em>, is my main contribution to the record. It started off as a stoner rock sludge fest but the band turned it into something incredible. Along with our usual instruments, I play the sitar and mellotron, while Jeff contributed the sleighbells and Mickey added the slide guitar. Psycho-jello, baby!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hardcorezen.info/i-gave-away-my-hat/1580/hat2" rel="attachment wp-att-1581"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1581" title="Hat2" src="http://hardcorezen.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Hat2-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>&#8220;No good deed goes un-posted,&#8221; said one of my Facebook friends when I posted that I had bought this nifty fake fur hat a couple mornings ago and then gave it away to a homeless man mere hours later.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not one of those kind, warmhearted people who feel great when they do something like that and then just can&#8217;t wait to tell the world about it. Sometimes I wish I was.</p>
<p>No. I&#8217;m kind of bummed that my hat is gone now. Well. It&#8217;s not gone. It&#8217;s on the head of a guy who lives under a bridge in Knoxville. Which is good, I guess. But I liked that hat. It was goofy. And I only just bought it!</p>
<p>My sister volunteers each week to help the homeless in Knoxville. My niece Skylar always goes with her. Stacey says she&#8217;s the one who keeps her going, Together they help out an organization called the <a href="http://lostsheepministry.org/" target="_blank">Lost Sheep Ministry</a> serve up free dinners to the people who live under one of the bridges of the I-40 Interstate in downtown Knoxville. Stacey invited me to come along since I&#8217;m in town this week. So I did. Then she said she really wanted me to blog about it. So I am. She did not tell me it would cost me my hat.</p>
<p>The day I went was their big Christmas dinner. So it wasn&#8217;t a typical night, from what I understand. There were a lot more people there to get fed and a lot more volunteers to handle the logistics. I didn&#8217;t end up doing a whole lot. I was assigned to garbage clean-up. So I just had to hang back until people had finished their meals and then go around with a garbage bag and collect the used Styrofoam plates, plastic forks and paper cups.</p>
<p>Stacey and Skylar knew a lot of the people out there, as you would if you went every week. Stacey was wearing a goofy hat too. Hers was even better than mine, a special Texas Tech Santa hat. She gave her hat away as well. Apparently Skylar once gave away her shoes. Stacey and Skylar always stop and have conversations with the people who live under the bridge. Some of them are their friends.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to feel moved to give stuff away when you&#8217;re out there, uh, giving stuff away. You know these people are way worse off than you are. So when they ask you for a hat, it feels right to give them your hat. Although I think I&#8217;d draw the line at shoes. Especially that night when it was cold and kind of wet out there. Though I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;d feel if the person asking had shoes as bad as the ones Skylar described on the person she gave her shoes to.</p>
<p>They had a band playing Christian rock. At one point the singer said, &#8220;This world isn&#8217;t our home! We have a much better one waiting for us!&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course that&#8217;s not actually true. Whether we have a better home somewhere else is arguable. But clearly God gave us a home at least for now and this world is it. Looking around that night I could see how the message that this isn&#8217;t where we really belong would play well to a crowd like that. A lot of them are having a shitty time, pretty much all the time. The idea of a better place somewhere off in the clouds must be very comforting.</p>
<p>As contemporary Buddhists living in the wealthy West, we easily forget what the original message Buddha preached actually was. Buddha was preaching mostly to an audience who lived pretty much like those homeless people under that bridge in Knoxville. Even if you were well-off in ancient India, your life probably wasn&#8217;t a lot more comfortable than the lives of poor folks today. Medicine was far less developed than it is today. Things we can cure with an injection, they died from, even with the best care money could buy. Sanitation was poor by our standards even for the well-to-do. There was no such thing as air conditioning or central heating for anyone, regardless of their wealth or status. Dental care was almost non-existent. Life was tough. It was natural to want out. When Buddha said that this world was the real world and that there was no heaven waiting for us at the end, it was a pretty radical thing to say.</p>
<p>Watching these Christians do their good work for the poor got me thinking about what Buddhists do for the poor. There are plenty of Buddhist charities all over the world, and there have been for thousands of years. The ones we have in the West are far less developed than those in Asia. We&#8217;ve had a lot less time to get it together. Besides, a Buddhist charity is a tougher sell over here. I can&#8217;t imagine you&#8217;d get by for long preaching Buddhist sermons under a bridge in East Tennessee. Even if you left the preaching out, once people found out you were Buddhists there&#8217;d be issues. Unfortunate but true.</p>
<p>The Engaged Buddhism stuff is interesting. Though sometimes I wonder if some of the motivation is the idea that we Buddhists aren&#8217;t as nice as those Christians so we&#8217;d better catch up. I know that&#8217;s not all it is. But I just wonder sometimes.</p>
<p>I think the most important thing is to always have the aim to do what we can whenever and wherever we can. It&#8217;s good to feed the homeless. It&#8217;s very good. But I think it&#8217;s important to continuously do small good things whenever we can without regard to who is more or less deserving of our help. It&#8217;s easy to make distinctions like that. But they&#8217;re not true. Everyone needs whatever we can give.</p>
<p>At the end of the meal, the Lost Sheep Ministry passed out Christmas stockings to everyone who came for the free food. I didn&#8217;t get a look at what was inside. But I&#8217;m guessing it was mainly practical stuff. It looked like some of them might have contained sleeping bags. But I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>And my hat was no longer mine. People are always asking me for magic meditations that will make them a &#8220;better person.&#8221; I suppose it&#8217;s depressing to think someone like me could do zazen for nearly thirty years, even getting to be a lineage holder and recognized authority on the subject, and yet still be bummed out about losing his goofy hat to someone who clearly needs it more than he does.</p>
<p>The difference now is that even though I remain bummed out about it, I no longer care. My feeling of bummed-out-ness is just a feeling. It comes and goes. Eventually it disappears completely. It&#8217;s insubstantial and not worthy of any great attention. It arises due to lingering greed that will also pass given enough time.</p>
<p>But dang. I liked that hat!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">•••</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hardcorezen.info/thoughts-on-the-tragedy-in-connecticut/1571/angels" rel="attachment wp-att-1573"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1573" title="Angels" src="http://hardcorezen.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Angels-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>I got the following question by email yesterday:</p>
<p><em> I know people live and then people die. I know. But this guy walked in and murdered 20 little kids. It was very real and it hurts, I don&#8217;t want to grieve and mourn like my Catholic family, I don&#8217;t want to hate this man and I don&#8217;t want to say these sweet angels are going to heaven because I don&#8217;t believe that. I believe that of all the things in the world, Buddhism has made the most sense. Your books have made the most sense. Will you please Brad Warner this one up and explain to me how to deal with this and how to make sense of it, if it&#8217;s even possible. How do I help others that feel the same way? My kids are in the same age group as those 20 kids, it hit home for me and many others. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll hear back from you, but I have to admit typing this out has made me feel a little less like I&#8217;m drowning in all my worries. Thank you for writing those books.</em></p>
<p>And thank you for writing me this email.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a TV. Actually, my roommates and I have a TV <em>set</em>. But it&#8217;s not hooked up to an antenna or cable. We just use it to watch DVDs. So my experience of this is probably somewhat unlike that of many Americans. It seems like whenever I visit people&#8217;s homes — I sleep on a lot of couches on my speaking tours! — they often have a TV that&#8217;s on for several hours every day. I&#8217;m guessing that news of the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut is on heavy rotation right now.</p>
<p>The media loves this kind of stuff. It&#8217;s terrific for ratings. A shooting at an elementary school around Christmas-time has got to be like a godsend for the news media. They&#8217;re going to milk it for all that it&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p>When that happens, we are shown a steady stream of images designed specifically to excite us and enhance whatever feelings of fear, grief, outrage, horror and so on that come up when things like this happen. It presents to us a consensus of what we supposedly <em>ought to</em> be feeling. Those of us who don&#8217;t feel the way the media is saying we ought to can often start to believe there&#8217;s something wrong with us. But that&#8217;s not true. It&#8217;s OK to feel however you feel about this.</p>
<p>As far as making sense of this tragedy, I think that might be impossible. Human beings often do things that are simply irrational and without any real sense. We&#8217;re driven by powerful forces that we cannot ever fully comprehend. In Buddhism we identify <em>greed, hate </em>and<em> delusion</em> as the three categories of things that drive us to do wrong. Once a month on the full moon people living at Zen monasteries gather together and chant, &#8220;All my ancient twisted karma, from beginningless greed, hate and delusion, born through body, speech and mind, I now fully avow.&#8221;</p>
<p>We all have greed, hate and delusion. The kid who shot those children wasn&#8217;t so different from us. But he failed to understand that the best way to deal with this is to refrain from doing wrong. In Buddhism we value refraining from doing wrong much more highly than doing right.</p>
<p>As for how to deal with it, I think we need to be practical. The Huffington Post has run some very good pieces about this. Here is a piece offering practical advice about how to help the victims of this terrible incident:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/14/connecticut-elementary-school-shooting-how-to-help_n_2302760.html" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/14/connecticut-elementary-school-shooting-how-to-help_n_2302760.html</a></p>
<p>And here is one by a Reverend from the United Church of Christ offering hints about what not to say to people who have been victims of acts like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-emily-c-heath/dealing-with-grief-five-t_b_2303910.html?ir=Healthy+Living" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-emily-c-heath/dealing-with-grief-five-t_b_2303910.html?ir=Healthy+Living</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if those children or their brave teachers are angels in Heaven now. But I do have a very strong conviction that they have not departed from this universe. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s really anywhere else they, or we, could go. The same applies to their killer. All of them live within us in a very real sense. Not just metaphorically, but actually.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, I mourn the loss of the victims and feel anger toward their killer. And I&#8217;m angry at the careless lobbyists and organizations who <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-16/ban-on-30-round-gun-magazines-in-connecticut-died-after-pressure.html" target="_blank">continue to allow this stuff to happen</a>. But my feelings of grief and anger contribute very little of any real value. They&#8217;re just feelings. They will pass.</p>
<p>I know you must fear for the safety of your own children now. My sister felt the same kind of fear when she took her 16 year old daughter, my niece, the great and wonderful Skylar, to school today. But just in terms of simple statistics, it&#8217;s very unlikely something like this will happen to your children or to Skylar. Luckily, we live in a pretty civilized country — even though it&#8217;s far too easy for insane people to get assault rifles and we really need to change that. You can&#8217;t protect your children from everything that might potentially harm them. That&#8217;s just an unfortunate fact.</p>
<p>My Zen teachers always said that the best thing to do with difficult feelings is to sit with them. I used to think they were crazy. But then I tried it and found out they were right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>Thank you for all your <a href="http://hardcorezen.info/donate" target="_blank">donations</a>. It&#8217;s really helped out with some recent unforeseen expenses.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hardcorezen.info/terrible-nicknames-to-earn/1555/samsung-3" rel="attachment wp-att-1557"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1557" title="SAMSUNG" src="http://hardcorezen.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Nicknames1-e1355513431643-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Someone forwarded me this exchange that appeared on the Sweeping Zen website:</p>
<p>Alain: &#8220;What we have here is a Zen prick (sorry I cannot call him a priest or teacher) that confuses his dick with a teaching stick. It is quite obvious to me that this Brad guy should not be a teacher, I simply cannot understand why he is a teacher in the first place. He seems to be more of the kind of a psychotic sexual predator who is desperately in need of help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grace Schireson: &#8220;Yes, something is definitely amiss with advocating this kind of self-indulgence as a Zen teacher. We are all struggling to express this as skillfully as we can. I appreciate your direct approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the record the views that I expressed which have earned me these nicknames are as follows:</p>
<p>1) I believe that the recent allegations about Joshu Sasaki are serious and merit investigation. I am pleased that his organization Rinzai-ji are doing that. I&#8217;m glad that someone associated with that organization (Eshu Martin) has finally addressed the matter publicly.</p>
<p>However, I do not know what actually went on in Sasaki&#8217;s sanzen room. I have been in communication with one woman who says that she doesn&#8217;t feel that what she experienced with Sasaki ought to be called &#8220;abuse&#8221; and that it was not even sexual in nature. I believe that she has every right to characterize her experience the way she wants to. I believe it is a kind of subtle sexism to try and tell her that she is wrong.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean I think it&#8217;s OK for Zen teachers to grope Zen students in the sanzen room. I was abundantly and unmistakably clear about that point already.</p>
<p>2) Grace Schireson expressed the opinion that all romantic involvement between anyone who can be defined as a &#8220;member of clergy&#8221; and anyone who can be defined as a &#8220;congregant&#8221; is unethical and ought to be illegal. I said this was absolutely wrong (yes, I did use the word &#8220;kuso&#8221; [shit] to describe her views, but only after Grace had used the word &#8220;kuso&#8221; to describe my views, I should have refrained from re-using her rude word).</p>
<p>Apparently there are folks who believe that the only reason I could hold views like these is because I want the freedom to use my position as a Zen teacher to get as much tail as possible. In fact, I never even thought of that as a reason to hold such views. If I had, I might have added something addressing that issue. It makes no sense to me that someone would believe that could be the only reason I&#8217;d think that way. It&#8217;s weird.</p>
<p>For the record, I hold my views about the Sasaki case because I was not there. That&#8217;s it. End of story.</p>
<p>My views about romance between so-called &#8220;clergy&#8221; and so-called &#8220;congregant&#8221; are somewhat more complex. I hold these views because if you have a religion in which the ordained &#8220;clergy&#8221; is not bound by a vow of celibacy then romances between &#8220;clergy&#8221; and &#8220;congregant&#8221; are inevitable. They <em>will</em> happen. Because this is a fact, I believe we need a realistic approach.</p>
<p>Jundo Cohen pointed out that a number of members of the American Zen Teachers Association (AZTA) are happily married to spouses they met when those spouses-to-be were their students. I personally know a few people who met their spouses under similar circumstances. It happens. It&#8217;s been happening in Japan since the Meiji Restoration in 1868 when the requirement for celibacy among Japanese Zen teachers was removed. It happend a lot even before, in fact, though it was seldom openly acknowledged until then.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really very simple. Take an unmarried non-celibate male Zen teacher, just for an example, though a female teacher might also experience the same thing. He is so dedicated to Zen that he has devoted his life to it. Maybe he has never married or even had a serious romantic relationship because he&#8217;s been so deeply involved in practice. But, like most people, he is lonely. Like most people, he would rather not sleep by himself every night. Like most people, he has a heart and can fall in love. And love tends not to obey the rules. Where is this teacher likely to meet a person who has anything close to the same level of interest in the one thing that is more important to him than anything else in the world?</p>
<p>a) At a bar</p>
<p>b) On ZenMasterDate.com</p>
<p>c) Among the people he teaches Zen to</p>
<div id="attachment_1566" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://hardcorezen.info/terrible-nicknames-to-earn/1555/zenbar" rel="attachment wp-att-1566"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1566" title="ZenBar" src="http://hardcorezen.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ZenBar-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Perhaps he would have some luck at this bar I spotted on Denmark St. in London.</p></div>
<p>Indeed there are people who take advantage of their position as a &#8220;member of clergy&#8221; and do bad things. I do not deny that. It&#8217;s serious. But to say that <em>all</em> romantic involvement between &#8220;member of clergy&#8221; and &#8220;congregant&#8221; is by definition &#8220;sexual abuse&#8221; is absurd. It&#8217;s the kind of view that will cause a world of hurt and pain for people who legitimately fall in love under difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>I have spoken to a number of protestant ministers and a few rabbis about this subject. Their religions have had to deal with this matter for hundreds of years, thousands in the case of Judaism. The consensus seems to be that such romances are strongly discouraged. In seminary, ministers in training are generally taught to avoid them. That&#8217;s not because they are by definition &#8220;abusive.&#8221; It&#8217;s because they are almost always problematic for the couple and for the congregation.</p>
<p>However, for the reasons I have outlined above, it is acknowledged that these things sometimes happen and that they will continue to happen so long as the clergy is non-celibate. When they do happen, the matter has to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, not with a blanket rule that assumes the clergy member must, by definition, be a &#8220;psychotic sexual predator&#8221; or something of the sort. Dealing with things case-by-case is the realistic way to handle it. Zen prides itself on being realistic and in dealing with pretty much everything on a case-by-case basis. I believe we should follow the very logical and sensible approach to the matter that has already worked for other religions with non-celibate clergy.</p>
<p>I am at a loss to understand why the fact that I believe these things means I am a &#8220;Zen prick&#8221; and a &#8220;psychotic sexual predator.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m averting my eyes from Sweeping Zen these days. But apparently everybody over there has an opinion about me. Someone told me there are at least five articles up there right now about this horrible Brad Warner pervert and perhaps hundreds of comments.</p>
<p>I find it interesting to observe my own reaction. If I were not me I would assume that Brad Warner would have a very hard time not looking at all this nonsense. But here in Brad Warner&#8217;s skin, I find that I have only a very minor interest in the matter. People keep forwarding things to me (that&#8217;s how I got the quote that leads off this article). But I feel no compulsion at all to go over there and read it for myself. Maybe one day I will. Who knows? For now it just doesn&#8217;t feel very compelling. It all seems kind of stupid. Although I will admit, it does make me angry when I do see it.</p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;ve been classifying Zen as a &#8220;religion&#8221; and its teachers as &#8220;clergy&#8221; in this article. I&#8217;m doing that for rhetorical purposes. I believe very strongly that Zen is not a religion nor are its teachers &#8220;members of clergy.&#8221; But I prefer to save that for another time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>Help Brad feel that some people still like him by <a href="http://hardcorezen.info/donate" target="_blank">sending him money</a> to pay his rent.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>Be sure and get psychotically sexually abused by me tomorrow at Hill Street Center 237 Hill St. Santa Monica CA 90405 from 9:50 AM till Noon! It&#8217;s our weekly Zen meeting. Or as I call it, &#8220;Groping time!&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently a couple of posts about me appeared on the Sweeping Zen website. These were written by Grace Schireson and her husband Peter Schireson. You will have to look them up yourself. I&#8217;m not interested in sending traffic to that website. I sent a response to these articles to Adam Tebbe, the editor of Sweeping Zen, after receiving an apology from him concerning some rather unfortunate discussions between us on Facebook.</p>
<p>I reproduce it here for your entertainment pleasure:</p>
<p><em>Adam,</em></p>
<p><em>I had planned a very different response to this apology. But then I saw Grace and Peter Schireson&#8217;s latest mean-spirited, nasty and accusatory pieces that you chose to run on Sweeping Zen and I have changed my mind.</em></p>
<p><em>Please remove all of my material from Sweeping Zen. You may keep the comments I&#8217;ve submitted because I understand that removing them would result in making the comments after them make little sense. But please remove all of my articles from the page as well as the interview that you conducted with me. I no longer wish to be associated in any way with Sweeping Zen.</em></p>
<p><em>You say </em>[text omitted because it is personal]<em> has made this a raw issue for you. I understand that and I am sorry for </em>[text omitted because it is personal]<em>. </em></p>
<p><em>But please also understand that my on-going relationship with L****** M******, whom I consider the one great love of my life and from whom I am quite thoroughly separated by circumstances I won&#8217;t go into here, is quite a raw issue for me. To see it characterized in the unfair and frankly childishly bullying way that Grace and Peter have done is extremely hurtful. They cannot possibly imagine how it feels to see that. Nor do I like the fact that L****** will probably once again get dragged into this mess (which is the last thing she needs right now) because of their posts. </em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore the idea that my opinions are merely the result of wanting to get as much tail as possible from students is deeply hurtful and offensive. It was interesting to see both &#8220;Stephanie&#8221; and Jundo Cohen, both of whom I have had some serious disagreements with in the past, rush in to explain that I am not at all like that. It was quite heartwarming to read at least that much in this ugly morass of mudslinging. No. My experience with L****** was nothing of the sort. Again, to see it characterized that way when I have already shared in great detail something that was extraordinarily difficult to share hurts a lot. L****** was brave enough to allow me to use her real name when doing so and it&#8217;s very troubling to see Mr. and Mrs. Schireson carelessly drag her into this. I&#8217;ll have to do some serious damage control now.</em></p>
<p><em>You may certainly share this email with Grace and Peter. I hope that you do. They ought to see it &amp; I do not know how to contact them. Nor do I wish to contact them. They are not nice people. But you MAY NOT share this email on Sweeping Zen, Facebook or any other public forum.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for doing this. And I do acknowledge your apology. Acceptance may take some time, however, due to these two articles. </em></p>
<p><em>Try to stay warm there in Ohio this season. I know how yucky it gets there this time of year. You have my sympathies as a fellow Ohioan!</em></p>
<p><em>Brad</em></p>
<p>So far it seems Mr. Tebbe has not removed my contributions, for which I was neither paid nor offered any remuneration and to which I retain all copyrights or the interview, which I now regret having done. Nor has he shared this with the Schiresons. He did, however, send me their email addresses. As I do not wish to communicate with either of these people, I will not be contacting them directly. If they or Mr. Tebbe choose to respond here, their comments will be deleted. Sorry. But it&#8217;s my blog, and it&#8217;s my prerogative to do so. They can say whatever they like in the many other forums available to them. This blog will not become a place them to debate this subject. Please excuse the inconvenience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>Please feel free to <a href="http://hardcorezen.info/donate" target="_blank">contribute</a> whatever revenue you think I stand to lose by having no further coverage on Sweeping Zen and probably a future of being bashed by their writers.</p>

<p>And if you want to <a href="http://youtu.be/nsFlrdXVFgo" target="_blank">sit some zazen</a> in LA tonight I&#8217;ll be hosting the usual Wednesday night session at Yogavidala in Los Feliz. The address is 4640 Franklin Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90027. Be there or be square. Be there and you can manifest the shape of the full moon! (Dogen nerds will get that joke)</p>
<p>On this coming Friday night (Dec. 7th, 2012 a day that will live in infamy!), also in Los Feliz, will be the world premiere of <em>Shoplifting From American Apparel</em> starring Brad Warner. To see more about that and to purchase tickets go to</p>

<p>You gotta buy the tickets on line! None will be available at the door! It&#8217;s gonna be a really cool show with lots of the cast and crew on hand as well as fabulous prizes and merchandise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sitting on my veranda with its lovely view of the 5 freeway, the Hyperion Street bridge and the magnificent Verdugo Mountains. It&#8217;s a brisk December morning here, 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius). The sun is shining and the smog is not too thick. Back in London it&#8217;s snowing. They&#8217;re riding sledges (aka sleds) up in Glasgow. It&#8217;s below freezing in Helsinki.</p>
<p>My trip to Europe this Fall is done. And what can I tell you about it? It was fun. Here&#8217;s the short version.</p>
<p>In Finland I led a weekend sesshin. I was severely jet-lagged and it was all I could do to stay upright during the first day&#8217;s zazen. I gave the precepts to three people, two Finns and one Scotsman who has live in Finland for ages. I hope they enjoy their precepts. I slept on a &#8220;Goldilocks bed&#8221; at the home of a guy named Mika. It was very short, but warm.</p>
<p><a href="http://hardcorezen.info/sitting-on-the-veranda-in-la-thinking-about-europe/1502/whitewine" rel="attachment wp-att-1511"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1511" title="whitewine" src="http://hardcorezen.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/whitewine-300x179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="179" /></a>In Malaga, Spain I addressed the International Lay Buddhists Forum, but did not get laid even once. What&#8217;s the deal with that? In the Oslo airport on the way down to Spain I paid $27 for egg and chips. Next time I&#8217;ll pack a sandwich. Burkhard, who organized the forum, called me &#8220;heteronormative&#8221; the first day we met. The whole front row was sound asleep when I gave my speech.</p>
<p>At the University of Koblenz I spoke to students in the afternoon and was videotaped. I wonder where that video will be shown. Then that evening I spoke to non-student type humans in what used to be a church of some sort. Or maybe it still is a church. A guy came with a ukulele. He didn&#8217;t play it, though. Across from my hotel were old German buildings and trees bursting with Autumn colors. The Muzak in the dining room played <a href="http://youtu.be/09yqFJZRaeg" target="_blank">Mack the Knife</a>. It was to be my last hotel stay of the tour. Usually people don&#8217;t put me up in hotels and I certainly cannot afford them for myself.</p>
<p>The train to Frankfurt wound past the Rhine river. In Frankfurt I spoke at the Dogen Zendo and then ate pizza. One guy who attended owned three of the <a href="http://youtu.be/96EuToAeJPI" target="_blank">Dimentia 13</a> albums! Golly! The following day I did what they called a <em>satsang</em> at Balance Yoga, also in Frankfurt. No one sang, but we sure sat! There I met another guy who had some of the Dimentia 13 albums! Were we big in Germany?</p>
<p>Then it was on to Berlin, where I re-visited Dharma Buchladen, where I had spoken twice before. My friend Vajra lent me his swingin&#8217; East Berlin pad while he went home to see his folks in Denver. Groovy! A girl named Nikita with long dreadlocks came to the talk because her mom told her to. But she liked the talk anyway. In Kruezburg a West Indian guy tried very hard to sell me marijuana. I did not buy it. But I did buy the German edition of <em>The X from Outer Space</em> (<a href="http://youtu.be/18oDVGD225s" target="_blank">Guila Frankensteins Teufelsei</a>).</p>
<p>Then it was on to Glasgow where Judi of Merchant City Yoga put on an exciting day of zazen, which was fun for all. I did two events in Glasgow, one evening talk followed by a day-long zen thing. The talk was an &#8220;In Conversation&#8221; format hosted by Dr Cynthia McVey. I liked that a lot. I went and saw my friend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt1a3MwW5BE" target="_blank">Nick</a> of My Niece&#8217;s Foot who I met when I first moved to Japan. He lives in Fife, Scotland now with his wife Tara and two children. I read Fox in Sox to them.</p>
<p><a href="http://hardcorezen.info/sitting-on-the-veranda-in-la-thinking-about-europe/1502/kunt" rel="attachment wp-att-1512"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1512" title="Kunt" src="http://hardcorezen.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Kunt-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Then I went to Manchester where I saw a fine performance by <a href="http://youtu.be/ivEmukhcJuM" target="_blank">Kunt and the Gang</a>. After that, it was off to Fawcett Mill Fields in the Lake District. There I led a three-day Zen thing with lots of dokusan (individual interviews with participants). We took a long muddy walk to see a stone circle and I thought of <a href="http://youtu.be/-wSCUfp_-as" target="_blank">Julian Cope</a>.</p>
<p>After that I was whisked off to Hebden Bridge, the Lesbian Capitol of Britain, where I did a day-long Zen thing at a local youth hostel. The name of the hostel was Mama Weirdigan&#8217;s! And my room was called Stoodley! I kid you not. They had a cute kitty cat. I did lots more dokusan. I found <a href="http://www.billoddie.com/" target="_blank">Bill Oddie&#8217;s</a> (of The Goodies) autobiography in a charity shop dedicated to local greyhounds. I didn&#8217;t buy it because it looked too heavy to add to my baggage. Then I ate delicious Tibetan food in the local Trade Union Hall.</p>
<p>Then it was back to Manchester where I did a talk, another &#8220;In Conversation&#8221; thing with a guy named Elliot. I&#8217;m sorry Elliot, I&#8217;ve forgotten your last name! That also went very nicely, although it was quite chilly in the schoolhouse where we did the talk.</p>
<p>Finally I rode the train down to London where I did a day of zazen at a place called the Vibast Community Center. It&#8217;s a community center on a council estate, which is what the British call a housing project. Though it wasn&#8217;t exactly the ideal venue for a day of zazen, it worked out just fine. I like doing zazen in non-ideal spaces. I think we need more of that. It&#8217;s lovely to do it in picturesque places far off in the country. But it&#8217;s also valuable to do it in the center of a big city with traffic noises in the background.</p>
<p>Big thanks to everyone who made this happen. If I start naming people, I&#8217;ll certainly leave some out. But here are a few who my jet-lagged brain can come up with today:</p>
<p>Thanks to Markus Laitinen of Kajo Zendo in Helsinki, to Prof. Burkhard Scherer for inviting me to Spain and setting it all up, to Wolf-Andreas Liebert at the University of Koblenz, to Regina Obendorfer of Dogen Zendo in Frankfurt, to Sybille Welker of Balance Yoga in Frankfurt, to Fritz at Dharma Buchladen, to Judi Ferrell in Glasgow, to Matt Ryan in <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/man-chest-hair-mw0002422788" target="_blank">Man Chest Hair</a>, to Rebecca Habergrahm in Hebden Bridge, to Alicia in London, to Norman Blair also in London and to everyone else I have forgotten because my brain is like jelly at the moment.</p>

<p>YOU MUST BUY TICKETS ON LINE TO GO! It sucks. We are well aware of the suckiness of this arrangement. We didn&#8217;t know about it until like three days ago. To buy tickets on line, go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://ilikenirvana.com/?page_id=277" target="_blank">http://ilikenirvana.com/?page_id=277</a></p>
<p>And then click on the city you want to see the movie in. Actually, if I did it right you ought to be able to click on the name of the city in this here blog. Tickets are $11. Even if you don&#8217;t like the movie you will still feel much better about supporting independent cinema than you would if you went to see some cruddy Hollywood piece of garbage. And it actually is a very funny, quirky, weird movie.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.deadendfollies.com/2012/11/movie-review-shoplifting-from-american.html" target="_blank">review of the movie from the website Dead End Follies</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on bunches of stuff and haven&#8217;t had a lot of time to keep up with blogging. Most pressing is the editing of my upcoming book. So far, the title is still <em>There is No God and He is Your Creator</em>. I hate always giving my books such long titles. But God is big, so the title ought to be big as well, I suppose.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the Joshu Sasaki case a lot as I&#8217;ve been traveling. I actually posted comments on a couple of the things Adam Tebbe has put up on Sweeping Zen about it. But I just have neither the time nor a reliable enough Internet connection to follow up on my own comments. So I have no idea if I&#8217;ve touched off a poop storm over there or just been ignored. Maybe one of these days I&#8217;ll go have a look.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Adam or some other people over there or even over here really understood what I was trying to say. I guess I&#8217;m not making myself clear. So I&#8217;ll have another quick go at it for what it&#8217;s worth (I doubt any of those people are looking at this blog anyway).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to cast doubt upon what Eshu Martin is saying about Sasaki. He says there have been allegations for years about Sasaki groping girls. There have, indeed, been such allegations. What Eshu Martin is saying is true.</p>
<p>Nor am I trying to say that groping girls in sanzen (aka dokusan, aka private one-on-one meetings between Zen student and Zen teacher) is OK. Groping girls in sanzen is not OK.</p>
<p>What I was trying to say is that (and forgive me if this happens not to apply to you, but I&#8217;m guessing what I&#8217;m about to say applies to everyone reading this blog) <em>you were not there</em>.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean you have no right to an opinion. It means you have the right to an opinion <em>as a person who was not there and who cannot ever know precisely what was going on</em>.</p>
<p>Such an opinion may have value. Often it does. Usually it doesn&#8217;t. In any case, we hear stories and immediately think we have had the experience described in the story — even if we understand intellectually that it didn&#8217;t happen to us. Then we react to it as if it happened to us. Only we&#8217;re not actually reacting to the event in question. We&#8217;re reacting to the pictures our brains have created in response to the story. And we may not have even understood correctly what the person who told the story is trying to convey.</p>
<p>In this case we have very little to go on. So the pictures we create based on such fragmentary evidence are highly dubious.</p>
<p>We want to divide the world into victims and aggressors. We want to champion the victims and destroy the aggressors. But the world really isn&#8217;t like that. It&#8217;s not that black and white. Never.</p>
<p>Also, people have a right to their stories. I cited the case of at least one woman who says she could be labeled as a &#8220;victim of Roshi&#8217;s abuse&#8221; but who does not see it that way at all. Why do we get to define her real experience for her based on a couple of sentences we&#8217;ve read on the Internet? What makes our definition based on a third hand fragment of a story outweigh her definition as a person who was actually there?</p>
<p>This is important. It does a lot of damage when we do that kind of thing. A lot.</p>
<p>I see that Rinzai-ji, Sasaki Roshi&#8217;s organization, is looking into the problem. I&#8217;m interested in seeing what comes out of that. Sasaki Roshi is one of the best Zen teachers out there. It would be a shame if his legacy were reduced to &#8220;he groped girls in sanzen.&#8221; On the other hand, if he really did grope girls in sanzen, maybe that ought to be part of his legacy as well. But so should the stories of people who were allegedly groped but who did not feel that &#8220;groped&#8221; was a valid definition of what happened to them. And if that makes you mad, keep telling yourself, &#8220;I was not actually there. I was not actually there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah well. I&#8217;m sure I messed up in trying to express what I think of this. But there you have it. Another attempt.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>This past weekend I was at a place called Fawcett Mill Fields in the Lake District of the UK. That&#8217;s a photo of the place at the top of this page. There I led a kind of &#8220;lite retreat.&#8221; It&#8217;s a new thing I&#8217;m experimenting with. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>A few years ago I led a retreat at the Southern Dharma Retreat Center, an organization that used to like me and invite me to do things but seems to have changed its collective mind about me for reasons I have yet to learn. It was a standard Zen retreat in which participants pretty did pretty much nothing but zazen for the entire weekend. There were no fun activities planned, no sight-seeing, no games, no workshops, no team building exercises, etc. Just a lot of sitting and staring at the wall punctuated by a few talks by me.</p>
<p>One women who showed up took a look at the schedule and said, &#8220;I gave up tickets to see the Dalai Lama for THIS??&#8221; Then stormed out, got in her SUV and sped off down the road in a shower of gravel, never to be seen again. To her, the schedule sounded like a big rip-off. And I began to think, &#8220;Am I ripping people off? Am I being lazy, not preparing all sorts of fun and frolic for people who come to my retreats? Other teachers do that. They come up with &#8216;workshops&#8217; and little get-together thingies and suchlike.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I thought, no. That&#8217;s not really it. The thing about a Zen retreat is that it gives you the opportunity to go very deeply into practice. And the only way to do that is to do the practice continuously over an extended period of time. Whenever you interrupt that flow, you interrupt the participant&#8217;s ability to really go as deeply as they can into the practice. There&#8217;s no way around it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, not everyone is ready for four hours of zazen at a time. An easier schedule might be more attractive to them. And it&#8217;s better to sit for an hour or two a day than not to sit at all. So I&#8217;m trying to introduce retreats that are more user-friendly.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve found, though, is that my audience is divided between people who are pretty experienced with Zen and people who are new to it. The experienced people who come to one of these &#8220;lite retreats&#8221; are disappointed because it&#8217;s not a real Zen retreat. And the ones who are completely new to it are disappointed because there&#8217;s too much sitting and staring at walls for them. I have come up with a way to disappoint everyone! Hooray!</p>
<p>That being said, the retreat went pretty nicely, I think. No one stormed off in a huff at least. As is typical these days, I did not spend much time doing zazen. Instead, I was stuck in a little room most of the time chatting with people. This is a tradition called &#8220;dokusan.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Zen we understand that every person&#8217;s experience of the practice is a little different. So while there are generalized lectures and instructions given to the group, the real meat of the teaching goes on behind closed doors in a one-to-one setting. What gets said in that little room is often completely inappropriate for public consumption, much the way that what gets said in a doctor&#8217;s office is not appropriate for public consumption. Although Zen teachers are not doctors, nor is dokusan a kind of psychotherapy session.</p>
<p>My own experience of dokusan is interesting to me. I stay as fully present as I possibly can with the person I&#8217;m speaking to. And I try to drop myself completely and act as a conduit for whatever needs to be spoken in that room. I know that sounds a bit spooky. But it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s still me sitting there talking. I&#8217;m not channeling anyone or any thing. And yet I try to step aside and let things just come forth as they do rather than putting my personal sense of self into it.</p>
<p>As a result I find I have a bit of amnesia. I can&#8217;t actually remember what was just said even if I try to jot down a few notes right afterward. I did that once, thinking maybe it could be useful in a book (after changing the names and eliminating anything too intensely personal or useful in trying to identify the person I was speaking with). But I couldn&#8217;t really do it. A few of those notes formed the basis for part of <a href="http://hardcorezen.info/store/zen-wrapped-in-karma-dipped-in-chocolate" target="_blank">Zen Wrapped in Karma Dipped in Chocolate</a>. But even there, I had to resort to generalizing because I simply couldn&#8217;t remember the actual details.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s odd I can&#8217;t recall these conversations. I can recall most of my conversations with friends. But when I&#8217;m talking with friends I&#8217;m doing something a bit different.</p>
<p>Fred posted an interesting video about Joshu Sasaki in the comments section of the previous piece. In the video a guy named Shinzen talks about his experiences in sanzen, which is what people in the Rinzai sect call dokusan, with Joshu Sasaki Roshi. It&#8217;s pretty neat. What he experienced with Sasaki is much like what I experienced in dokusan with Nishijima Roshi and with Tim. (This has nothing to do with the issue of Sasaki&#8217;s supposed sexual harassment, by the way.)</p>
<p>And yet now that I sit on the other side of the room I sometimes wonder what people experience when they talk to me. Surely it can&#8217;t be anything like what Shinzen describes. After all, it&#8217;s just me they&#8217;re talking to!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hardcorezen.info/everybody-knows/1469/joshu_2" rel="attachment wp-att-1470"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1470" title="joshu_2" src="http://hardcorezen.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/joshu_2-226x300.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="300" /></a>Hello from your roving Zen reporter, reporting to you today from Glasgow, Scotland where the weather is damp and rainy. &#8220;That&#8217;s nowt rrrain, laddie!&#8221; they tell me, &#8220;That&#8217;s nowt bot <a href="http://sco.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Scots-English-Scots_dictionar#S" target="_blank">smirr</a>!&#8221; Yet it seems like rain to me. Or drizzle at least.</p>
<p>Yesterday I visited my old friend Nick Wilding aka Vic Wild Thing the fiddle player of the band <a href="http://youtu.be/m3btU9eN0M0" target="_blank">My Niece&#8217;s Foot</a> for whom I played bass in Japan way back in <a href="http://frogreview.tumblr.com/post/7518997277/grandpa-simpson" target="_blank">nineteen-diggity-two</a> or whenever the hell I lived in Japan. Nick&#8217;s into human ecology, sustainability, community action and all of that wonderful stuff. He has two lovely children who are extremely energetic. Zing! And a lovely wife Tara and two kitty-cats.</p>
<p>The talk and one-day retreat in Glasgow last weekend were amazing. You should&#8217;ve been there! Judi Ferrell of Merchant City Yoga hosted and her friend Cynthia McVey did the first night&#8217;s talk in an &#8220;In Conversation&#8221; format. She interviewed me on stage. This is a lot more fun than the usual thing where I just talk at the audience for a while to try to stimulate them to ask questions or otherwise respond. Part of it was video&#8217;d and all of it was audio recorded. As long as I don&#8217;t lose the files before I can upload them, maybe you&#8217;ll be seeing or hearing the results soon.</p>
<p>There are still a few UK dates left. They are:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nov. 23-25 (Fri-Sun) Weekend Sesshin at Fawcett Mill Fields, Penrith, Lake District  UK Sponsored by <a href="http://www.yoga-manchester.co.uk/">Yoga Manchester</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nov. 25 (Sun) Manchester, England Sponsored by <a href="http://www.yoga-manchester.co.uk/">Yoga Manchester</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nov. 27-28 (Tues-Wed) Hebden Bridge Zen Group, UK contact Rebecca at <a href="mailto:rebeccahabs@googlemail.com" target="_blank">rebeccahabs@googlemail.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dec. 2 (Sun) London, England, The Vibast Community Centre, 163 Old Street, EC1V 9NH, for info <a href="mailto:sacredalchemyevents@hotmail.com" target="_blank">sacredalchemyevents@hotmail.com</a></p>
<p>The Lake District thing and the Hebden Bridge thing are both longer retreat type events. Although you can also come on Tuesday night to Hebden Bridge and just hear the talk if you don&#8217;t want to commit to sitting all day on Wednesday. The events in Manchester and London are just talks. Easy-peasy! As always, all of my events are on my <a href="http://hardcorezen.info/events" target="_blank">Events Page</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing to me that I can come to places like Glasgow, Berlin, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Warsaw and a host of other (to me) exotic locales and get rooms full of people, while I only seem to be able to attract the same six people to my regular sittings in Los Angeles. What is up with LA people? You can&#8217;t sit still for a little while?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>In Buddhist news, Joshu Sasaki Roshi, Leonard Cohen&#8217;s Zen master and one of my first teacher&#8217;s teachers, a guy whose book I often recommend as one of the best on Zen practice, has been <a href="http://sweepingzen.com/everybody-knows-by-eshu-martin/" target="_blank">outed on Sweeping Zen</a> as a sex pervert by my buddy Eshu Martin up in Victoria, BC.</p>
<p>Like Eshu says, &#8220;everybody knows&#8221; and has known about this for ages. It&#8217;s one of those things you hear about in Zen circles. Yet nobody really knows precisely what went on other than those who were present at the time.</p>
<p>The very first commenter on Eshu&#8217;s piece when it appeared on Facebook said, &#8220;Glad you&#8217;re saying it. It needs to be outed and stopped in every community.&#8221; He is a man, by the way*. This is the common response. I don&#8217;t find it very interesting or useful. It&#8217;s the same old stuff. Everybody loves a lynching. Even you. Trust me. You do. (Yes, I&#8217;m talking about you.) So when we find someone who falls into our own personal category of &#8220;lynchable&#8221; we are ready to go after him. All of us. But is that really where we want to go?</p>
<p>If you are keen to seriously dig into this and not just opt out for the knee-jerk response, there are some comments on Eshu Martin&#8217;s Facebook page from a woman who was&#8230; Well, what was she exactly? One would generally say she was a &#8220;victim&#8221; of the Roshi&#8217;s abuse. But she doesn&#8217;t feel that way at all.</p>
<p>She says, in part, &#8220;It&#8217;s so easy to make someone wrong. I &#8216;suffered Roshi&#8217;s abuse&#8217; and it was the closest I ever got to god.&#8221; She goes on to state that, &#8220;Everyone knew about it, everyone talked about it. Oshos (Sasaki Roshi&#8217;s higher level assistant priests) were distressed about it. Processes were put in place. We were constantly being offered support around it&#8230; well handled I thought.&#8221; She says a whole lot more. But I already feel like maybe I&#8217;m overstepping some of those unknowable Internet protocols by quoting her here. The post I&#8217;m referencing appeared on Eshu&#8217;s Facebook profile page on November 16th. Dig for yourself and maybe you&#8217;ll find it.</p>
<p>This is very interesting to me. It&#8217;s incredibly easy to slip into habitual modes of thinking around hot button issues like this. It&#8217;s important to be very careful about that sort of thing. Which isn&#8217;t a way of saying that I think hetero male Zen teachers ought to grope their female students so they can get closer to God. There really is such a thing as sexual abuse and some of it happens with Zen teachers. But then there are far more complicated things that also happen for which there is no category.</p>
<p>I feel like our need to slot things into established categories may be one of the deepest problems we have to uproot as human beings pursuing the dharma. It&#8217;s a survival skill we need, this categorizing of things. It&#8217;s what keeps us alive. If I&#8217;m walking down the street in a foreign country at night, as I often am these days, I have to watch people closely. If a group of guys is giving off signals I read as potentially dangerous, I walk down another street.</p>
<p>Maybe they&#8217;re perfectly nice people. Maybe they&#8217;re just excited about a football match they just saw. But I have no way to know. So I categorize quickly and act accordingly. This is what we all do all the time.</p>
<p>But we also have a tendency to go too far with this. Or to believe that the categories in which we place things are true or absolute. That becomes a problem if our aim is to see all of life just as it is.</p>
<p>I feel like Eshu&#8217;s article and the response it is generating are very important and interesting. I&#8217;m glad he said what he said. I&#8217;m waiting for more.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered what was really going on around Joshu Sasaki. He is one of the best expounders of what Zen is all about that I have ever encountered. His book <em>Buddha is the Center of Gravity</em> is absolutely one of the best out there. He knows his stuff. His teaching methods in all areas have always been unorthodox. Not just the sex stuff that&#8217;s now being talked about, but everything he does.</p>
<p>The female commenter on Eshu&#8217;s Facebook clearly states that she does not consider what Sasaki did to her or to the other women at his center that she talked to as &#8220;sexual abuse&#8221; or even as sex at all.</p>
<p>Curioser and curioser. This deserves a closer look.</p>
<p>* I was wrong. The commeter in question was female.</p>
